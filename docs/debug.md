[@ng-apimock/core](https://github.com/ng-apimock/core) uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug).

### Running
You can debug the core by enabling it.

For Windows:
```bash
set DEBUG=ng-apimock:*
```
or macOS
```bash
export DEBUG=ng-apimock:*
```

Logging is now enabled. You can also make logging more specific, for instance:
```
set DEBUG=ng-apimock:handler*
```
